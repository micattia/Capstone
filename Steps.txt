After Checking the data we come to do some 
   Data explatory analysis.

Univariate analysis
 - complete first part for statistics
 - check missing values for each column and see what to do with it
 - rename the Adj close if needed
 - create a histogram to see the distribution
 - Create a boxplot to illustrate the distribution of values
 - 

Bivariate analysis
 - Create a scatterplot to illustrate the relationship between two columns
 - correlation 
 - Hypothosis tests 

Multivariate analysis
 
====================================================
attribute reduction

spliting the data into Training and Test

Building the model
 1- Regression
    a- Linier
	b- logestic
	c- knn-regresion
	
 2- Classification
 add clasification column (increased/unchanged - decreased) during same day
 add clasification column (increased/unchanged - decreased) next day
	a- 
	b- 
	
evaluating each model and mesuring accuracy 
try accuracy for the same date, next day, in 10 days
merge the data sets to add the volume into the calculations
